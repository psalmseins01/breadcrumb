# Responsive Sidebar & Breadcrumb Navigation

## 📘 Overview

This project is a **responsive web application layout** that features a **collapsible sidebar navigation** and a **breadcrumb trail** for page hierarchy. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and enhanced with **Font Awesome** for icons and **Google Fonts** for typography.

The design focuses on clarity, accessibility, and scalability. The sidebar can collapse or expand dynamically, while the breadcrumb provides intuitive navigation context to the user.

This project serves as a foundational component for larger web applications and will evolve to include new features such as dynamic dashboards, authentication, analytics widgets, and theme customization.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Responsive Design**

The layout uses **media queries** to adjust to different screen widths. On smaller screens, the sidebar becomes a collapsible overlay instead of a fixed column.

### 2. **Flexbox Layout**

The `display: flex` property ensures adaptive alignment and spacing between sidebar and main content.

### 3. **DOM Manipulation**

The sidebar toggle button triggers JavaScript functions that add or remove classes (`.active`, `.show`) to control the visibility of UI components.

### 4. **Breadcrumb Navigation**

The breadcrumb improves UX by visually indicating the current page hierarchy using icons and link separators.
